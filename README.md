# WPF Snake Game

## **Description**

## **Features**

- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Control the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself.
- **Food Spawning:** Apples appear randomly on the grid, and the snake grows each time it eats one.

- **Screen Wrap-Around:** The snake wraps around the edges of the screen, reappearing on the opposite side.
- **Collision Detection:** Includes checks for collisions with the snake's own body.
